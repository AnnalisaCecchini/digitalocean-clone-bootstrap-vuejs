### :fire: Features
--------

:white_check_mark: **Bootstrap**   
I followed closely [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) homepage design, by using Bootstrap.  
Bootstrap is a front-end open source toolkit, with a **responsive grid system** and prebuilt components.  
I used components for layout, navbar, jumbotron, buttons and forms.  

- [Bootstrap Layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/)
- [Bootstrap Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)

----------

The layout is totally responsive, it fits all screens of different devices automatically to display content, in a way that **user feels comfortable**.

### :iphone: Mobile-first
----------

The layout is Mobile-Fist Designed, I started the website production **from the mobile end**, which has more restrictions. Then, expanding its features.
